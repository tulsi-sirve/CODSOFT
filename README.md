## Description
- Titanic Survival Predication : Predicting Titanic survival involves building a model to determine whether a passenger aboard the RMS Titanic survived the disaster or not. The sinking of the Titanic in 1912 is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, resulting in significant loss of life. This prediction task is a classic example in the field of machine learning and data science, often used for educational purposes and as an introduction to predictive modeling.
  
- Movie Rating Prediction using python : Movie rating prediction is a regression problem where we try to predict the rating of a movie based on various features.movie rating prediction is a challenging problem due to the sparsity of the data and the subjectivity of the ratings. However, with the right preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation techniques, it is possible to build accurate movie rating prediction models using Python.
  
- Sales Prediction using python : Sales prediction using Python involves leveraging machine learning techniques to forecast the amount of a product that customers will purchase based on various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection. The process typically includes steps such as data collection, preprocessing, feature selection/engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and prediction. Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib/seaborn are commonly used for data manipulation, machine learning modeling, and visualization.
